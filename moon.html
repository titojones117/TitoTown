    The moon was completely full and red as the sunset in the sky in Palos Verdes.<br>
    I fear for the day the moon will no longer exist.<br> </p>

    <p><h2>July 5th, 2025</h2><h3>Phase: Waxing Gibbous<br>Illumination: 74%</h3>The moon is 11% brighter.<br>
        Sometimes when I look at the moon, I imagine myself there.<br> Away from all my worries and troubles. <br>
        The moon landing was definitely fake.<br>There is no way someone actually step foot on that thing.

    <p><h2>July 4th, 2025</h2><h3>Phase: Waxing Gibbous<br>Illumination: 66%</h3>Who would've known the moon would be so beautiful from afar.<br>
       I cannot believe I am living this right now.<br> Sometimes I wonder what the moon will look like
        when I die.
